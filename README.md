 #  Artinerary
   

## Description 

Artinerary is a web application that was created to address the issues of isolation and overall mental wellness among artists during the COVID-19 pandemic. The application is partially based on the research of one of the creating developers. The research substantiates the use of the creation, viewing, and community-interaction benefits of art-making to support overall health and mental wellness outcomes.  

The application is intended to emulate the experience of attending a "Drink & Draw" event.  During the events several artists surround source material (usually a figure) and create their own versions of the source material.  During breaks, artists walk around the room and view and talk with other artists about their work and gain inspiration to influence their work.  

Artinerary allows the user to choose from different source material, and create their own version of the source material.  They can then utilize their sign-in credentials to upload their own work.  Although sign-in is required to upload work, anyone can enjoy the benefits of viewing all artwork.  When a user clicks on a specific source material, they are presented with a page that includes the source material at the top, and below all the versions of the work created by users are displayed below.  This is meant to emulate the sense of walking around the room at an arts event and create a sense of shared experience and inspiration.
